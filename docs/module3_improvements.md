# Module 3 — Planned Improvements

Notes from a design discussion (2026-06). Not yet implemented; captured here so the
direction isn't lost. Two themes: **smarter selection** and **hyperparameter coverage**,
which meet at `image_size`.

## 1. Selection is too coarse / not smart enough

Current structured score uses only 4 signals (data_size match, priority-vs-complexity,
`preferred_when` bonus, `few_shot` bonus), then merges 60% structured / 40% vector.

Weaknesses:

- **Near-ties decided by noise.** `data_size` has 3 buckets, `priority` 3 values. Rankings
  sit very close (observed: efficientnet 0.691 vs dinov2 0.67) so small Module-1 wording
  changes flip the pick. Needs a principled tiebreak — e.g. **cost-aware**: when scores are
  within ε, prefer the lighter / cheaper backbone.
- **Signals already collected but unused** (highest ROI — just wire them up):
  - `domain_transfer` (strong/moderate/weak) on backbones
  - `recommended_when` on pretrained_model nodes
  - **Module 2 image statistics** (resolution, colour mode, format) — dropped in
    `merge_modules`, never reach Module 3 (see §3)
  - `preferred_when` edges on loss / pretrained nodes (dead data)
- **No task-character signal.** Fine-grained tasks (e.g. cassava leaf disease) favour
  full-finetune CNNs + higher resolution, but the system can't tell. Source could be
  Module 1 (LLM extracts "fine-grained") or Module 2 (intra-class similarity).
- **Vector weight (40%) is shaky** — cosine of the query against a one-paragraph backbone
  description. Consider demoting it to a tiebreaker, or enriching descriptions.
- **`_select_components` uses `candidates[0]`** for head/optimizer — order-dependent and
  fragile (existing known issue).

## 2. Hyperparameters — principled split, not ad-hoc

Decide each HP by one test: *"would changing it change which model is the right pick, or
just how to run the chosen model on this machine?"*

| Class | Owner | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Model-coupled / recommendation-level | **Module 3** (the "recipe") | learning_rate (head_only→high, full→low), image_size, scheduler type, augmentation strength, epoch budget |
| Execution / hardware | **Module 4** | batch_size (OOM auto-retry / grad-accum), num_workers, mixed_precision, gradient_clip, checkpoint cadence |
| Needs runtime feedback | **Module 4** (only it sees training dynamics) | early stopping, lr warmup auto, OOM retry |

Module 4 already sets some of these by default — make the split **explicit and principled**,
not accidental.

⚠️ **Provenance**: once HPs come from three places (Module 3 recipe, Module 4 defaults, the
orphan `recommended_epochs` in `pipeline.py`), the final config is hard to reason about. The
merged recipe should record where each value came from.

## 3. Wire Module 2 statistics into selection

`merge_modules` (pipeline.py) currently keeps only `total_images`→data_size, `num_classes`,
and `class_distribution`→class_imbalance. It **drops** the resolution (min/max/avg width &
height), colour `mode_distribution`, and `format_distribution` that Module 2 computed.

Fix, following the existing `derive_*` pattern:

1. Add `derive_*` helpers turning raw stats into semantic signals: `resolution_tier`
   (low/medium/high), `color_mode` (rgb/grayscale), maybe `size_variability`.
2. Extend the Module 3 input schema with these fields.
3. Consume them in the recipe layer — primarily for `image_size`.

## 4. The convergence point: `image_size`

`image_size = f(backbone constraints, data resolution, task fine-grainedness)`
— DINOv2 needs multiples of 14; EfficientNet-B3 wants 300; Module 2 gives the data
resolution; Module 1 gives fine-grainedness. It is both a hyperparameter (§2) and a
consumer of Module 2 data (§3). Getting it right also matters for speed (image decode was
the training bottleneck on Colab).

## 5. Recipe layer — proposed v0

A small **recipe module** that Module 3 calls, mapping
`(backbone family, finetune_strategy, data_size, image stats)` → HPs.

- **v0 scope: just `image_size` + `learning_rate`** — smallest slice with a complete loop
  (Module 2 → Module 3 plumbing + recipe + Module 4 hand-off). Validate the chain, then add
  scheduler / epochs / augmentation.
- Open question: live inside Module 3, or as a standalone module Module 3 calls (preferred —
  isolated, testable, independently iterable).

## 6. Make it measurable — catalog as eval harness

`vision_benchmark_catalog.py` (14 datasets + baselines) is a ready-made evaluation set.
Stand up a harness that runs "Module 3 pick → train → compare to baseline" so every change
to selection or the recipe is judged by **real scores**, not hand-tuning. Do this early so
§1–§5 are data-driven.

## 7. Beyond rules: data-driven ranking & ensembles (Phase 3+)

Hand-written rules hit a hard ceiling for two things: **ranking in-budget candidates by
expected accuracy**, and **ensembles** (which need to reason about *complementary* errors, a
combinatorial/data problem rules can't express). The fix is to split selection into stages
and make ranking signal-driven, not rule-driven:

```
A  Candidate generation:  KB + rules + budget filter   → shortlist of viable configs
                          (rules belong HERE only — pruning the search space; extensible via KB)
B  Ranking signal:        a point on the cost/accuracy spectrum below (dataset-specific)
C  Compute allocation:    multi-fidelity (Hyperband / successive halving)
D  Output:                greedy ensemble selection over survivors (not "pick top-1")
```

### The ranking-signal spectrum (B)

Pick/combine points by available compute — it is **not** one method:

| Cost | Signal | Gives |
|---|---|---|
| **0 (no run)** | public-benchmark predictor / **LLM-as-prior ranker** / kNN to similar datasets (dataset2vec) | cold-start prior, broad but black-box |
| **~0 (forward only)** | **transferability metrics (LogME / LEEP / SFDA)** ⭐ | a score predicting *finetuned* ranking from frozen features — cheaper than a probe and predicts finetuning, not just frozen accuracy |
| **cheap** | frozen-feature **linear probe** (reuses our feature cache) | dataset-specific accuracy proxy |
| **mid** | **1-epoch screen + successive halving** | kill weak candidates, give compute to survivors |
| **full** | real training (the harness) | ground truth — for **calibration**, not the bottleneck |

### Key reframes

- **transferability metrics (LogME)** beat a plain linear probe: nearly free, and purpose-built
  to rank source models for a target without finetuning. Best starting point for B.
- **multi-fidelity** (Hyperband) is the principled way to spend a fixed budget across
  candidates — the bridge between cheap proxy and real training; turns the harness from "run
  everything" into "allocate smartly".
- **ensembles as the strategy, not an afterthought**: cheaply screen a small portfolio, keep
  3–4 survivors, greedily combine complementary ones. "Selection" becomes "allocate compute +
  combine" — exactly what wins Kaggle, and zero hardcoded rules.
- The homegrown **harness is demoted** from foundation to a calibration/validation tool; the
  probe/LogME signal is dataset-specific and needs no cold-start data collection.

### Recommended starting point

A **LogME (or linear-probe) ranker** over the in-budget candidates, reusing the existing
frozen-feature cache: rank B by a cheap dataset-specific signal instead of heuristics. Then
layer multi-fidelity (C) and greedy ensemble (D) on top. Rules stay confined to A.

## Suggested order

1. Wire unused signals (esp. Module 2 image stats → image_size) + cost-aware tiebreak.
2. Recipe layer v0 (image_size + lr).
3. Catalog eval harness (in parallel, so 1–2 are measurable) — now a calibration tool (§7).
4. Phase 3 ranker: LogME/linear-probe over in-budget candidates (§7 B), then multi-fidelity + ensemble.

## Status

- **2026-06-14 — constraint-aware selection Phase 1+2 (done).** Added a cost model
  (`estimate_cost`, per-checkpoint `flops_g`@224 scaled by image_size; `params_M` already on
  nodes) and a numeric budget filter (`max_params_m` / `max_flops_g` in `constraints`) wired
  into checkpoint candidate selection — over-budget checkpoints are dropped and a backbone
  auto-downgrades to its largest fitting variant. KB gained `resnet18_imagenet` and
  `efficientnet_lite0` for tight-budget coverage. **Still open (Phase 3):** ranking the
  in-budget candidates by *expected accuracy* (needs the catalog/outcome memory), and broader
  efficient-backbone coverage / compression for very tight budgets.
