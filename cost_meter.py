"""Process-global cost meter for one pipeline+train run.

Tracks the things that make Jiaozi's efficiency the selling point — LLM calls,
LLM tokens, training runs/epochs, and wall-clock — so a run's *cost* can be reported
and compared head-to-head against an agentic pipeline (AIDE / MLE-STAR).

Instrumentation is best-effort and must never break a call site: record_* swallows
nothing of value but is wrapped in try/except by callers.
